## Requirements

### Create a paginated result endpoint

We have supplied this project with a SQLite database file (data.db). Within the database you will find a table called _user_, a table called _image_, and a table called _attribute_user_ (association table). Create an endpoint `/users` where the user can `GET` a paginated result that returns a list of all the users with their relevant images and attributes. The parameters to this endpoint should be `offset` and `limit` (e.g. `/users?offset=20&limit=20`). We expect the returned data to look like this:

```
data: [
  {
   first_name: "xxx",
   ...
   media: [{name: "xxx", ...}, ...],
   attributes: [{name: "xxx"}, ...]
  },
  {
   first_name: "yyy",
   ...
   media: [{name: "xxx", ...}, ...],
   attributes: [{name: "xxx"}, ...]
  },
  ...
],
pagination: {
  total_user: <total number of users in db>,
  total_pages: <total_users / limit>
  offset: <current offset>,
  limit: <current limit>
}
```

_NOTE: Please sort the media by the created (it's a timestamp) column, newest first_

### Allow us to create a new user

Create an endpoint that allows us to insert a new user into the database. Please properly validate all the input. Failed validation should be returned with a helpful indication of what failed. After a successful creation the user object should be returned (as JSON) with a 200 status code.

_NOTE: The user should be at least 18 years old_
